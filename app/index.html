Whether you have had
counselling or therapy before, or this is your first time, you will likely
have many questions about me and how I will be able to help you. Having
followed a training that required me to have therapy myself I know how
important it is to feel you are in safe hands.  If your questions are
not answered here don't hesitate to contact me to get more information.<ul><li><img src="coap.jpg" alt="Colegio Oficial Psicologos Madrid"></li><li><img src="eap.jpg" alt="English Association Psychotherapists"></li></ul><h1>Interests</h1><h2>Relationship issues</h2><p>We are always in relationship, to ourselves, others and the world.</p>So whatever you bring will be about a relationship. However, I have
a particular interest and training in the different stages of love...
whether you are looking for love, struggling within a relationship,
deciding whether to separate or have separated or divorced.<h2>Online therapy</h2><p>Need some help or some therapy, but location, family, travel committments,</p>restricted mobility or some other reason makes it difficult for you to come
to any of my locations?

Maybe online therapy could be a possiblity for you.
Online therapy can be cheaper and after an initial consultation can be arranged
at a time to suit you. Contact me to see if it could work for you.<h2>Groups</h2><p>Introduction to  Mindfulness in English Mindful parenting.</p>Mindful mornings.
